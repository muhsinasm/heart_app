# 💓 Heart Disease Prediction App

This is a machine learning-based web app that predicts the risk of heart disease using various health parameters. The model is built using **Logistic Regression** and is designed for simplicity, accuracy, and real-time usage. The application was developed in **Google Colab**, deployed using **GitHub**, and hosted on **Streamlit**.

## 📌 Features

- Predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease  
- Takes user input through a friendly web interface  
- Provides instant results with a basic health tip  
- Mobile and desktop compatible  
- Clean, easy-to-understand design

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for initial visualization)  
- Google Colab (for development)  
- Streamlit (for front-end deployment)  
- GitHub (for version control and hosting)

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters health details like age, cholesterol, chest pain type, etc.  
2. The input data is preprocessed (missing values handled, encoding applied).  
3. The trained Logistic Regression model predicts the presence or absence of heart disease.  
4. The result is displayed instantly with a tip encouraging a healthy lifestyle.

## 💡 Motivation

As a second-year B.Tech student in **Applied Electronics & Instrumentation**, this project was my first real-world application of machine learning. It helped me explore how simple models like Logistic Regression can have meaningful impacts, especially in health diagnostics, even for students from a non-medical domain.
